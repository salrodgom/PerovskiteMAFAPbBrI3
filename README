DESCRIPTION OF FILES:

VASP INPUT FILES:

"INCAR_CsPbIr_Br.txt" - VASP input file for Caesium-based perovskites
"INCAR_FAPbBr2I.txt" - VASP input file for Formamidinium-based perovskites
"INCAR_MAPbBr2I.txt" - VASP input file for Formamidinium-based perovskites
"INCAR_distortion.txt" - VASP input file used for distorted structures (needed for FLAMA inputs)

LAMMPS INPUT FILES:

"input_NPT_lat_par_calculation" - LAMMPS input file to extract lattice parameter from NPT simulations
"input_XRD_lammps" - LAMMPS input file to extract X-ray diffraction data
"input_MD_lammps - main input LAMMPS file to run MD simulations including thermalization (see LAMMPS users manual for more info)
"coordenadas.dat" - model parameters and atom coordinates. It is read by LAMMPS prior to each calculation. Should be adapted to the desired perovskite material.
